    # How to Build a Paper Airplane \
    Follow these easy steps to make a classic paper airplane! \
    ## Materials Needed  \
    - 1 sheet of letter-sized paper (8.5\" x 11\") \
    1. **Prepare the Paper**  \
       - Place the paper on a flat surface in a **vertical orientation** (portrait style) so the long sides are on the left and right. \
       - Fold the paper in half vertically to create a **crease down the center**. This line will guide the following folds. \
       - Unfold to return the paper to its original flat state.",
    
    " # Section 2 \
    2. **Fold the Top Corners to the Center** \
       - Take the top-left corner of the paper and fold it down toward the center crease, aligning the edge with the crease to form a triangle. \
       - Repeat on the top-right corner, bringing it to meet the center crease and creating a **pointed top**.", 
    
    " # Section 3 \
    3. **Fold the Sides Toward the Center** \
        - Fold each side of the paper again toward the center crease, starting from the outer edges. \
        - This will create a longer, **sharper triangle** shape, with a pointed tip at the top.",
    
    " # Section 4 \
    4. **Create the Wings** \
       - Flip the airplane over so the triangle is facing down. \
       - Fold each side downward to form the wings, aligning the edges of the paper with the bottom of the airplaneâ€™s body. \
       - Make sure both wings are even so your airplane flies straight. \
    ## Ready for Takeoff! \
    Now your paper airplane is ready to fly! Hold it gently near the bottom and launch it forward for the best flight."
